# The International Debt Analysis Using SQL

### International Debt Analysis
This project aims to analyze the international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset provides information on the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. Here are the key questions we seek to answer:

- What is the total amount of debt owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
- Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
- What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

### Dataset
The dataset is sourced from The World Bank, an organization that provides debt to countries. The table contains information on different debt indicators, such as the purpose of taking debt and the category of these debts.

### Key Findings
There are 124 countries in our dataset
There are 25 distinct debt indicators
The total amount of debt owed by all countries is over 3 trillion USD
China owns the highest total debt of all countries
The average amount of debt owed by countries varies across different debt indicators

### Methodology
We used SQL queries to extract information from the dataset. For instance, we used COUNT and DISTINCT functions to find the total number of countries and the distinct debt indicators. We also used SUM and AVG functions to find the total and average amount of debt owed by countries. Finally, we used GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses to group and sort the data.

Overall, this analysis provides a glimpse into the state of the international debt economy.
